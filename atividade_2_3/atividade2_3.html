            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
            printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
            dummy text ever since the 1500s,
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
            only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting There are many variations
            of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
            but the majority have suffered alteration in
            <br><br>
            going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure
            there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
            middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
            Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
            necessary, making this the first true generator on the
            Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
            words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,
            to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

            <b>Loren Ipsum</b>
            <br><br>
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
            Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
            <br> <br>
            Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
            Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
            source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
            <br><br>
            of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
            during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
            section 1.10.32. <br><br>
            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
            original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
